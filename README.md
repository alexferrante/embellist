Hack for Spotify's devX Stockholm 2017

"musicScapes" generates a minimalistic landscape based on your recent Spotify activity.

The mountains and peaceful colors are generated from the audio features of the last 50 songs you've listened to. The landscape changes depending on if you listen to happy or sad songs, energetic or calm ones, if you've been a recent active listener and other track features.

Listen to a couple new songs and see how it reflects on your landscape.

This app was originally created as part of Spotify's devX hackathon in Stockholm, 2017.

The app has been developed by:
Nadia Campo Woytuk - front end
Stefan Aleksik - back end

Using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [randomColor](https://randomcolor.llllll.li/)
